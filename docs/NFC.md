# Is including NFC the right thing to do?

At this time, it does seem to be. The following are some notes.

## What are the advantages of normalizing?

 - Portability - Text that isn't normalized is interpreted and displayed in
   different ways, depending on the environment. Normalization ensures that, in
   aspects related to normalization, content is independent of the environment.

   A common argument for non-normalized text is that some fonts render them
   differently from their normalized counterparts, and users may specifically
   wish to use the non-normalized versions. However, content that does this may
   not display properly in other environments using different fonts, so we
   specifically want to avoid such situations.

 - Avoiding common application bugs - Normalization eliminates some situations
   where two strings that look the same contain different scalar values, making
   content easier to work with.

## Which normalization form?

NFC seems to be [by far the most widely used for text interchange], and mostly
preserves the meaning of all practical Unicode text (see the following sections
for more discussion), so it seems the best choice for the [Basic Text] format.

Requiring that everything be compatibility-normalized can eliminate several
cases of visual ambiguity, and NFKC is a subset of NFC, so it seems the best
choice for the [Restricted Text] format.

## Specific concerns

The following are some notes from researching situations where NFC has been
considered to be semantically lossy.

### CJK Compatibility Ideographs

Unicode includes 1002 CJK Compatibility Ideograph scalar values which were
originally intended only for use in preserving round-trip compatibility with
other character set standards. However, many of them are associated with
slightly different appearances, and this has led to a lot of confusion and some
dispute.

For example, the scalar value U+2F8A6 canonically decomposes to U+6148. This
means that Unicode considers these two scalar values to be canonically
equivalent, such that they are required have
[the same visual appearance and behavior]. Some systems do treat them this way,
however many popular systems today display them slightly differently.

[the same visual appearance and behavior]: https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Canon_Compat_Equivalence

Users understandably expect that the difference in appearance is significant
and will use non-canonical forms specifically for their unique appearance:

 - https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-core/2009JanMar/0216.html
 - https://www.w3.org/wiki/I18N/CanonicalNormalizationIssues#Problems_with_canonical_singletons

At one point, the Unicode committee even
[considered defining "variant normal forms"] which would be identical to NFC
and NFD except for excluding these CJK Compatibility Ideographs, however did
not end up pursuing the idea.

[considered defining "variant normal forms"]: https://www.unicode.org/review/pr-7b.html

[As of Unicode 6.3], all 1002 of these scalar values have standardized
variations which allow them to be normalized into a form which records the
scalar value they were normalized from. We use a [modified version] of the NFC
algorithm which uses these variation sequences instead of the standard
canonical decompositions, which will produce valid NFC output, but which
preserves the information about which specific CJK Compatibility Ideographs
were used.

TODO: Update this link once this PR either lands or is resolved in some other way.

[modified version]: https://github.com/unicode-rs/unicode-normalization/pull/70

At this time, it appears most implementations don't currently implement these
variation sequences, so the characters in this form still unfortunately will
often not display as intended. But at least this way, all the information is
preserved, so if implementations wish to implement them, they can be displayed
as intended.

### Biblical Hebrew

According to Unicode, this was once a problem, but [there's a fix now].

### Bugs in implementations and fonts

Many apparent issues with NFC turn out to be issues with specific
implementations or specific fonts, which tend to fade away over time as
software is updated. Such issues are not considered here.

An example of this is [here](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T7948).

### Greek Polytonic Support

Early versions of Unicode appear to have used a confusing appearance for the
TONOS mark, and several fonts developed at the time did as well. See:

 - https://www.opoudjis.net/unicode/unicode_gkbkgd.html

Unicode was updated to use a different appearance, and newer fonts seem to use
it, and this seems to be a satisfactory solution.

### Greek Ano Teleia (U+0387)

Unicode canonicalizes the Greek Ano Teleia (U+0387) into
Middle Dot (U+00B7), which doesn't preserve its appearance and
creates problems with parsing because U+00B7 is often considered
an identifier character (middle dot is used as such in languages
such as Catalan), while the Greek actual ano teleia is considered
punctuation. See the following links for details:

 - http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2011/05/20/10166588.html
 - https://op111.net/2008/03/17/linux-greek-punctuation-ano-teleia/

U+0387 was added, along with the canonical decomposition to U+00B7, in
Unicode 3.1, published in March 2001.

This issue [may not be Unicode-specific].

According to (English) Wikipedia, this character is [infrequently encountered].

Greek Wikipedia seems to use U+0387 and U+00B7 [interchangeably].

The Unicode Standard, section 7.2 Greek, paragraph Compatibility Punctuation,
addresses the display and compatibility concerns:

> ISO/IEC 8859-7 and most vendor code pages for Greek simply make use of
semicolon and middle dot for the punctuation in question. Therefore, use of
U+037E and U+0387 is not necessary for interoperating with legacy Greek data,
and their use is not generally encouraged for representation of Greek
punctuation.

That leaves the question of punctuation vs. identifier unaddressed though.
Theoretically a solution to this might be to add a new scalar value to Unicode
and transition Greek text content to using that instead of U+0387. However,
as far as I'm aware no one has proposed this yet.

Since this appears to be the only such issue, it doesn't by itself seem to
be sufficient reason not to use normalization.

### W3C Guidance

The W3C says specs should not specify normalization for storage/interchange:

 - https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod-norm/#normalizationChoice

and suggests an approach where specs normalize only when needed, and ideally
only internally to other algorithms that need it.

The rationale can be summed up as:

> Normalization can remove distinctions that the users applied intentionally.

As discussed in the above sections, almost all of the places where information
about such distinctions seem to be lost either have satisfactory solutions,
or are caused by bugs or missing features in fonts or Unicode implementations.

There is also a difference in priorities; this plain text format is all about
building the foundations of a platform for the future, while the W3C is
concerned about helping users use the Web today, so this format is more
inclined to accept problems if they are believed to merely be limitations
of today's environments that can be fixed.
