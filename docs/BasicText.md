# Basic Text

The *Basic Text* format is a subset of the [Unicode] format and meant to
fulfill common notions of "plain text".

Basic Text permits homoglyphs and other visual ambiguities; see
[Restricted Text] for an alternative which might provide some mitigations.

For rationale and background information, see [Background]. For a prototype
implementation, see [the Github repo].

## Definitions

A string is in Basic Text form iff:
 - it is a [Unicode] string in [Stream-Safe] [NFC] form, and
 - it doesn't start with a [Basic Text non-starter], and
 - it doesn't end with a [Basic Text non-ender], and
 - it doesn't contain any of the sequences listed in the [Tables].

A stream is in Basic Text form iff:
 - it consists entirely of a string in Basic Text form, and
 - it is empty or ends with U+A.

A buffered stream is in Basic Text form iff:
 - the stream is in Basic Text form, and
 - substrings of the string separated by buffer flushes are all in Basic Text
   form.

### Supplementary definitions

#### Basic Text non-starter
[Basic Text non-starter]: #basic-text-non-starter

A Unicode scalar value is a Basic Text non-starter iff:
 - it is a [normalization-form non-starter], or
 - its [`Grapheme_Cluster_Break`] is `ZWJ`, `SpacingMark` or `Extend` and it
   isn't U+34F.

#### Basic Text non-ender
[Basic Text non-starter]: #basic-text-non-ender

A Unicode scalar value is a Basic Text non-ender iff:
 - its `Grapheme_Cluster_Break` is `ZWJ` or `Prepend`.

## Conversion

### From Unicode string to Basic Text string

To convert a [Unicode] string into a Basic Text string in a manner that always
succeeds, discarding information not usually considered meaningful or valid in
plain text:
 - If the string starts with a [Basic Text non-starter], prepend U+34F.
 - If the string ends with a [Basic Text non-ender], append U+34F.
 - Perform the Replacement actions from the [Pre-NFC Table].
 - Perform the [Stream-Safe Text Process (UAX15-D4)].
 - Perform `toNFC` with the [Normalization Process for Stabilized Strings].
 - When [*NEL Compatibility*] is enabled, replace any U+85 with U+A.
 - When [*LSPS Compatibility*] is enabled, replace any U+2028 or U+2029 with
   U+A.
 - Perform the Replacement actions from the [Main Table].

[*NEL Compatibility*]: #options
[*LSPS Compatibility*]: #options

#### Options

The following options may be enabled:

| Name               | Type    | Default |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------- |
| NEL Compatibility  | Boolean | `false` |
| LSPS Compatibility | Boolean | `false` |

### From Unicode string to Basic Text string, strict

To convert a [Unicode] string into a Basic Text string in a manner that
discards information not usually considered meaningful and otherwise fails if
the content is not valid Basic Text:
 - If the string starts with a [Basic Text non-starter], error with "Basic Text
   string must not begin with Basic Text non-starter".
 - If the string ends with a [Basic Text non-ender], error with "Basic Text
   string must not end with Basic Text non-ender".
 - Perform the Error actions from the [Pre-NFC Table].
 - Perform the [Stream-Safe Text Process (UAX15-D4)].
 - Perform `toNFC` with the [Normalization Process for Stabilized Strings].
 - Perform the Error actions from the [Main Table].
 - When [*CRLF Compatibility*] is enabled, replace any U+A with U+D U+A.

[*CRLF Compatibility*]: #options

#### Options

The following options may be enabled:

| Name               | Type    | Default |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------- |
| CRLF Compatibility | Boolean | `false` |

### From Unicode stream to Basic Text stream

To convert a [Unicode] stream into a Basic Text stream in a manner than always
succeeds, discarding information not usually considered meaningful or valid in
plain text:
 - If the stream starts with U+FEFF, remove it.
 - Perform [From Unicode string to Basic Text string].
 - If the stream is non-empty and doesn't end with U+A, append a U+A.

To convert a [Unicode] stream into a Basic Text stream in a manner that
discards information not usually considered meaningful and otherwise fails if
the content is not valid Basic Text:
 - When [*BOM Compatibility*] is enabled, insert a U+FEFF at the beginning of
   the stream.
 - Perform [From Unicode string to Basic Text string, strict].
 - If the stream is non-empty and doesn't end with U+A, error with
   "Basic Text stream must be empty or end with newline".

| ------------------ | ------- | ------- |
| BOM Compatibility  | Boolean | `false` |

### From Unicode buffered stream to Basic Text buffered stream

To convert a [Unicode] buffered stream into a Basic Text buffered stream in a
manner than always succeeds, discarding information not usually considered
meaningful or valid in plain text:
 - Perform [From Unicode stream to Basic Text stream].
 - At each buffer flush:
   - If the flush is preceeded by a [Basic Text non-ender], append U+34F before
     the flush.
   - If the flush is followed by a [Basic Text non-starter], insert U+34F after
     the flush.

### From Unicode buffered stream to Basic Text buffered stream, strict

To convert a [Unicode] buffered stream into a Basic Text buffered stream in a
manner that discards information not usually considered meaningful and
otherwise fails if the content is not valid Basic Text:
 - Perform [From Unicode stream to Basic Text stream, strict].
 - At each buffer flush:
   - If the flush is preceeded by a [Basic Text non-ender], error with "Basic
     Text string must not end with a Basic Text non-ender" before the flush.
   - If the flush is followed by a [Basic Text non-starter], error with "Basic
     Text string must not start with a Basic Text non-starter" after the flush.
