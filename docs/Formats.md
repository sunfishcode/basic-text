# Formats

This site discusses three formats.

 - [Unicode](Unicode.md)
   - Any sequence of [Unicode Scalar Values], encoded with a standard
     [Unicode encoding form].

 - [Basic Text](BasicText.md)
   - This is intended to realize the intuitive phrases "text" or "plain text"
     which are used in many contexts. It excludes control characters and other
     content unnecessary or impractical for text.

 - [Restricted Text](RestrictedText.md)
   - Restricted Text is a hypothetical format at this time.
   - Like Basic Text, but aims to reduce visual ambiguity by trading off some
     support for historical scripts, multiple-script text, formatting, and
     symbols.

The [background information] contains rationale and source information.
